        alt="Symmetric-key cryptography, where a single key is used for encryption and decryption"> 
      <p>Symmetric-key cryptography refers to encryption methods in which both the sender and receiver share the same key (or, less commonly, 
            in which their keys are different, but related in an easily computable way). This was the only kind of encryption publicly known 
            until June 1976.</p>
      <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/af/International_Data_Encryption_Algorithm_InfoBox_Diagram.svg/220px-International_Data_Encryption_Algorithm_InfoBox_Diagram.svg.png" 
        alt="One round (out of 8.5) of the IDEA cipher, used in most versions of PGP and OpenPGP compatible software for time-efficient encryption of messages"> 
      <p>Symmetric key ciphers are implemented as either block ciphers or stream ciphers. A block cipher enciphers input in blocks of plaintext 
          as opposed to individual characters, the input form used by a stream cipher. </p>
      <p>The Data Encryption Standard (DES) and the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are block cipher designs that have been designated 
          cryptography standards by the US government (though DES's designation was finally withdrawn after the AES was adopted). 
          Despite its deprecation as an official standard, DES (especially its still-approved and much more secure triple-DES variant) 
          remains quite popular; it is used across a wide range of applications, from ATM encryption to e-mail privacy and secure remote access. 
          Many other block ciphers have been designed and released, with considerable variation in quality. Many, even some designed by capable 
          practitioners, have been thoroughly broken, such as FEAL.</p>
      <p>Stream ciphers, in contrast to the 'block' type, create an arbitrarily long stream of key material, which is combined with the plaintext 
          bit-by-bit or character-by-character, somewhat like the one-time pad. In a stream cipher, the output stream is created based on 
          a hidden internal state that changes as the cipher operates. That internal state is initially set up using the secret key material. 
          RC4 is a widely used stream cipher. Block ciphers can be used as stream ciphers by generating blocks of a keystream (in place of 
          a Pseudorandom number generator) and applying an XOR operation to each bit of the plaintext with each bit of the keystream.</p>
      <p>Cryptographic hash functions are a third type of cryptographic algorithm. They take a message of any length as input, and output 
          a short, fixed-length hash, which can be used in (for example) a digital signature. For good hash functions, an attacker cannot 
          find two messages that produce the same hash. MD4 is a long-used hash function that is now broken; MD5, a strengthened variant 
          of MD4, is also widely used but broken in practice. The US National Security Agency developed the Secure Hash Algorithm 
          series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; SHA-1 is widely deployed and 
          more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the SHA-2 family improves on SHA-1, 
          but is vulnerable to clashes as of 2011; and the US standards authority thought it "prudent" from a security perspective 
          to develop a new standard to "significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall hash algorithm toolkit." 
          Thus, a hash function design competition was meant to select a new U.S. national standard, to be called SHA-3, by 2012. 
          The competition ended on October 2, 2012, when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA-3 hash algorithm. 
          Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible, cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot 
          be used to retrieve the original input data. Cryptographic hash functions are used to verify the authenticity of data 
          retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security. </p>
      <p>Message authentication codes (MACs) are much like cryptographic hash functions, except that a secret key can be used to 
          authenticate the hash value upon receipt; this additional complication blocks an attack scheme against bare digest algorithms, 
          and so has been thought worth the effort.</p>
     <h2>-Public-key cryptography:</h2>

         alt="Public-key cryptography, where different keys are used for encryption and decryption.">

         alt="Padlock icon from the Firefox Web browser, which indicates that TLS, a public-key cryptography system, is in use."> 
         <p>Symmetric-key cryptosystems use the same key for encryption and decryption of a message, although a message or group of messages 
             can have a different key than others. A significant disadvantage of symmetric ciphers is the key management necessary to use them 
             securely. Each distinct pair of communicating parties must, ideally, share a different key, and perhaps for each ciphertext 
             exchanged as well. The number of keys required increases as the square of the number of network members, which very quickly 
             requires complex key management schemes to keep them all consistent and secret. </p>
         <p>In a groundbreaking 1976 paper, Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman proposed the notion of public-key (also, more generally, 
             called asymmetric key) cryptography in which two different but mathematically related keys are used—a public key and a private key. 
             A public key system is so constructed that calculation of one key (the 'private key') is computationally infeasible from the other 
             (the 'public key'), even though they are necessarily related. Instead, both keys are generated secretly, as an interrelated pair. 
             The historian David Kahn described public-key cryptography as "the most revolutionary new concept in the field since polyalphabetic 
             substitution emerged in the Renaissance".</p>
         <p>In public-key cryptosystems, the public key may be freely distributed, while its paired private key must remain secret. 
             In a public-key encryption system, the public key is used for encryption, while the private or secret key is used for decryption. 
             While Diffie and Hellman could not find such a system, they showed that public-key cryptography was indeed possible by presenting 
             the Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol, a solution that is now widely used in secure communications to allow two parties 
             to secretly agree on a shared encryption key. The X.509 standard defines the most commonly used format for public key certificates.</p>
         <p>Diffie and Hellman's publication sparked widespread academic efforts in finding a practical public-key encryption system. 
             This race was finally won in 1978 by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Len Adleman, whose solution has since become known 
             as the RSA algorithm.</p>
         <p>The Diffie–Hellman and RSA algorithms, in addition to being the first publicly known examples of high-quality public-key algorithms, 
             have been among the most widely used. Other asymmetric-key algorithms include the Cramer–Shoup cryptosystem, ElGamal encryption, 
             and various elliptic curve techniques.</p>
         <p>A document published in 1997 by the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), a British intelligence organization, 
             revealed that cryptographers at GCHQ had anticipated several academic developments. Reportedly, around 1970, 
             James H. Ellis had conceived the principles of asymmetric key cryptography. In 1973, Clifford Cocks invented a solution 
             that was very similar in design rationale to RSA. In 1974, Malcolm J. Williamson is claimed to have developed 
             the Diffie–Hellman key exchange.</p>
         <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/Private_key_signing.svg/250px-Private_key_signing.svg.png" 
         alt="In this example the message is only signed and not encrypted. 1) Alice signs a message with her private key. 2) Bob can verify that Alice sent the message and that the message has not been modified.">
         <p>Public-key cryptography is also used for implementing digital signature schemes. A digital signature is reminiscent of an ordinary
              signature; they both have the characteristic of being easy for a user to produce, but difficult for anyone else to forge.
              Digital signatures can also be permanently tied to the content of the message being signed; they cannot then be 'moved' 
              from one document to another, for any attempt will be detectable. In digital signature schemes, there are two algorithms: 
              one for signing, in which a secret key is used to process the message (or a hash of the message, or both), and one for verification, 
              in which the matching public key is used with the message to check the validity of the signature. RSA and DSA are two of 
              the most popular digital signature schemes. Digital signatures are central to the operation of public key infrastructures 
              and many network security schemes (e.g., SSL/TLS, many VPNs, etc.).</p>
         <p>Public-key algorithms are most often based on the computational complexity of "hard" problems, often from number theory. 
             For example, the hardness of RSA is related to the integer factorization problem, while Diffie–Hellman and DSA are related 
             to the discrete logarithm problem. The security of elliptic curve cryptography is based on number theoretic problems involving 
             elliptic curves. Because of the difficulty of the underlying problems, most public-key algorithms involve operations 
             such as modular multiplication and exponentiation, which are much more computationally expensive 
             than the techniques used in most block ciphers, especially with typical key sizes. As a result, 
             public-key cryptosystems are commonly hybrid cryptosystems, in which a fast high-quality symmetric-key encryption algorithm 
             is used for the message itself, while the relevant symmetric key is sent with the message, but encrypted using a public-key algorithm. 
             Similarly, hybrid signature schemes are often used, in which a cryptographic hash function is computed, 
             and only the resulting hash is digitally signed.</p>

     <h2>-Cryptanalysis:</h2> 
         <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Enigma.jpg/220px-Enigma.jpg" 
         alt="Variants of the Enigma machine, used by Germany's military and civil authorities from the late 1920s through World War II, implemented a complex electro-mechanical polyalphabetic cipher. Breaking and reading of the Enigma cipher at Poland's Cipher Bureau, for 7 years before the war, and subsequent decryption at Bletchley Park, was important to Allied victory."> 
         <p>The goal of cryptanalysis is to find some weakness or insecurity in a cryptographic scheme, thus permitting its subversion 
             or evasion.</p>
         <p> It is a common misconception that every encryption method can be broken. In connection with his WWII work at Bell Labs, 
             Claude Shannon proved that the one-time pad cipher is unbreakable, provided the key material is truly random, never reused, 
             kept secret from all possible attackers, and of equal or greater length than the message. Most ciphers, 
             apart from the one-time pad, can be broken with enough computational effort by brute force attack, 
             but the amount of effort needed may be exponentially dependent on the key size, as compared to the effort needed to 
             make use of the cipher. In such cases, effective security could be achieved if it is proven that the effort required 
             (i.e., "work factor", in Shannon's terms) is beyond the ability of any adversary. 
             This means it must be shown that no efficient method (as opposed to the time-consuming brute force method) 
             can be found to break the cipher. Since no such proof has been found to date, the one-time-pad remains 
             the only theoretically unbreakable cipher. Although well-implemented one-time-pad encryption cannot be broken, 
             traffic analysis is still possible. </p>
         <p>There are a wide variety of cryptanalytic attacks, and they can be classified in any of several ways. 
             A common distinction turns on what Eve (an attacker) knows and what capabilities are available. 
             In a ciphertext-only attack, Eve has access only to the ciphertext (good modern cryptosystems are usually effectively 
             immune to ciphertext-only attacks). In a known-plaintext attack, Eve has access to a ciphertext and its corresponding 
             plaintext (or to many such pairs). In a chosen-plaintext attack, Eve may choose a plaintext and learn its corresponding 
             ciphertext (perhaps many times); an example is gardening, used by the British during WWII. In a chosen-ciphertext attack, 
             Eve may be able to choose ciphertexts and learn their corresponding plaintexts. Finally in a man-in-the-middle attack 
             Eve gets in between Alice (the sender) and Bob (the recipient), accesses and modifies the traffic and then forwards it 
             to the recipient. Also important, often overwhelmingly so, are mistakes (generally in the design or use of one 
             of the protocols involved). </p>
         <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ad/2008-09_Kaiserschloss_Kryptologen.JPG/220px-2008-09_Kaiserschloss_Kryptologen.JPG" alt="Poznań monument (center) to Polish cryptanalysts whose breaking of Germany's Enigma machine ciphers, beginning in 1932, altered the course of World War II">
         <p>Cryptanalysis of symmetric-key ciphers typically involves looking for attacks against the block ciphers or stream ciphers 
             that are more efficient than any attack that could be against a perfect cipher. For example, a simple brute force attack 
             against DES requires one known plaintext and 255 decryptions, trying approximately half of the possible keys, 
             to reach a point at which chances are better than even that the key sought will have been found. 
             But this may not be enough assurance; a linear cryptanalysis attack against DES requires 243 known plaintexts 
             (with their corresponding ciphertexts) and approximately 243 DES operations. This is a considerable improvement 
             over brute force attacks. </p> 
         <p>Public-key algorithms are based on the computational difficulty of various problems. 
             The most famous of these are the difficulty of integer factorization of semiprimes and the difficulty of calculating 
             discrete logarithms, both of which are not yet proven to be solvable in polynomial time using only 
             a classical Turing-complete computer. Much public-key cryptanalysis concerns designing algorithms in P 
             that can solve these problems, or using other technologies, such as quantum computers. For instance, 
             the best-known algorithms for solving the elliptic curve-based version of discrete logarithm are much more time-consuming 
             than the best-known algorithms for factoring, at least for problems of more or less equivalent size. 
             Thus, other things being equal, to achieve an equivalent strength of attack resistance, factoring-based encryption 
             techniques must use larger keys than elliptic curve techniques. For this reason, public-key cryptosystems based on 
             elliptic curves have become popular since their invention in the mid-1990s</p>
         <p>While pure cryptanalysis uses weaknesses in the algorithms themselves, 
             other attacks on cryptosystems are based on actual use of the algorithms in real devices, 
             and are called side-channel attacks. If a cryptanalyst has access to, for example, 
             the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or PIN character, 
             he may be able to use a timing attack to break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis. 
             An attacker might also study the pattern and length of messages to derive valuable information; 
             this is known as traffic analysis and can be quite useful to an alert adversary. Poor administration of a cryptosystem, 
             such as permitting too short keys, will make any system vulnerable, regardless of other virtues. 
             Social engineering and other attacks against humans (e.g., bribery, extortion, blackmail, espionage, torture, ...) 
             are usually employed due to being more cost-effective and feasible to perform in a reasonable amount of time compared 
             to pure cryptanalysis by a high margin. </p>
        <h2>-Cryptographic primitives:</h2>
          <p>Much of the theoretical work in cryptography concerns cryptographic primitives—algorithms with basic cryptographic 
              properties—and their relationship to other cryptographic problems. More complicated cryptographic tools are then built 
              from these basic primitives. These primitives provide fundamental properties, which are used to develop more complex tools 
              called cryptosystems or cryptographic protocols, which guarantee one or more high-level security properties. Note, however, 
              that the distinction between cryptographic primitives and cryptosystems, is quite arbitrary; for example, the RSA algorithm 
              is sometimes considered a cryptosystem, and sometimes a primitive. Typical examples of cryptographic primitives include 
              pseudorandom functions, one-way functions, etc.</p>
        <h2>-Cryptosystems:</h2> 
           <p>One or more cryptographic primitives are often used to develop a more complex algorithm, called a cryptographic system, 
               or cryptosystem. Cryptosystems (e.g., El-Gamal encryption) are designed to provide particular functionality 
               (e.g., public key encryption) while guaranteeing certain security properties (e.g., chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security 
               in the random oracle model). Cryptosystems use the properties of the underlying cryptographic primitives to support 
               the system's security properties. As the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary, 
               a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems. In many cases, 
               the cryptosystem's structure involves back and forth communication among two or more parties in space 
               (e.g., between the sender of a secure message and its receiver) or across time (e.g., cryptographically protected backup data). 
               Such cryptosystems are sometimes called cryptographic protocols. </p>
           <p>Some widely known cryptosystems include RSA encryption, Schnorr signature, El-Gamal encryption, PGP, etc. 
               More complex cryptosystems include electronic cash systems, signcryption systems, etc. Some more 'theoretical'
               [clarification needed] cryptosystems include interactive proof systems, (like zero-knowledge proofs), 
               systems for secret sharing, etc. </p>
        <h2>-Lightweight cryptography:</h2>  
          <p>Lightweight cryptography (LWC) concerns cryptographic algorithms developed for a strictly constrained environment. 
              The growth of Internet of Things (IoT) has spiked research into the development of lightweight algorithms 
              that are better suited for the environment. An IoT environment requires strict constraints on power consumption, 
              processing power, and security. Algorithms such as PRESENT, AES, and SPECK are examples of the many LWC algorithms 
              that have been developed to achieve the standard set by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>
