    <h1> History of cryptography and cryptanalysis:-</h1>
     <p>Before the modern era, cryptography focused on message confidentiality (i.e., encryption)—conversion of messages 
         from a comprehensible form into an incomprehensible one and back again at the other end, rendering it unreadable by interceptors 
         or eavesdroppers without secret knowledge (namely the key needed for decryption of that message). Encryption attempted to ensure 
         secrecy in communications, such as those of spies, military leaders, and diplomats. In recent decades, the field has expanded 
         beyond confidentiality concerns to include techniques for message integrity checking, sender/receiver identity authentication, 
         digital signatures, interactive proofs and secure computation, among others. </p>
    <h2>-Classic cryptography:</h2>
     <p> The main classical cipher types are transposition ciphers, which rearrange the order of letters in a message 
         (e.g., 'hello world' becomes 'ehlol owrdl' in a trivially simple rearrangement scheme), and substitution ciphers, 
         which systematically replace letters or groups of letters with other letters or groups of letters (e.g., 'fly at once' 
         becomes 'gmz bu podf' by replacing each letter with the one following it in the Latin alphabet). 
         Simple versions of either have never offered much confidentiality from enterprising opponents. 
         An early substitution cipher was the Caesar cipher, in which each letter in the plaintext was replaced by a letter some fixed 
         number of positions further down the alphabet. Suetonius reports that Julius Caesar used it with a shift of three to communicate 
         with his generals. Atbash is an example of an early Hebrew cipher. The earliest known use of cryptography is some carved ciphertext 
         on stone in Egypt (ca 1900 BCE), but this may have been done for the amusement of literate observers rather than as a way of 
         concealing information. </p>

     alt="Reconstructed ancient Greek scytale, an early cipher device"> 
     <p> The Greeks of Classical times are said to have known of ciphers (e.g., the scytale transposition cipher claimed to have been 
         used by the Spartan military). Steganography (i.e., hiding even the existence of a message so as to keep it confidential) was 
         also first developed in ancient times. An early example, from Herodotus, was a message tattooed on a slave's shaved head and concealed 
         under the regrown hair. More modern examples of steganography include the use of invisible ink, microdots, and digital watermarks to 
         conceal information.  </p>
     <p>In India, the 2000-year-old Kamasutra of Vātsyāyana speaks of two different kinds of ciphers called Kautiliyam and Mulavediya. 
         In the Kautiliyam, the cipher letter substitutions are based on phonetic relations, such as vowels becoming consonants. 
         In the Mulavediya, the cipher alphabet consists of pairing letters and using the reciprocal ones.</p>
     <p>In Sassanid Persia, there were two secret scripts, according to the Muslim author Ibn al-Nadim: the šāh-dabīrīya 
         (literally "King's script") which was used for official correspondence, and the rāz-saharīya which was used to communicate 
         secret messages with other countries.</p>
     <p>David Kahn notes in The Codebreakers that modern cryptology originated among the Arabs, the first people to systematically 
         document cryptanalytic methods. Al-Khalil (717–786) wrote the Book of Cryptographic Messages, which contains the first use of 
         permutations and combinations to list all possible Arabic words with and without vowels.</p>

     alt="First page of a book by Al-Kindi which discusses encryption of messages"> 
     <p>Ciphertexts produced by a classical cipher (and some modern ciphers) will reveal statistical information about the plaintext, 
         and that information can often be used to break the cipher. After the discovery of frequency analysis, by the Arab mathematician 
         and polymath Al-Kindi (also known as Alkindus) in the 9th century, nearly all such ciphers could be broken by an informed attacker. 
         Such classical ciphers still enjoy popularity today, though mostly as puzzles. Al-Kindi wrote a book on cryptography 
         entitled Risalah fi Istikhraj al-Mu'amma (Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages), which described the first known
         use of frequency analysis and cryptanalysis techniques. An important contribution of Ibn Adlan (1187–1268) was on sample size for 
         use of frequency analysis.</p>

     <p>Language letter frequencies may offer little help for some extended historical encryption techniques such as homophonic cipher 
         that tend to flatten the frequency distribution. For those ciphers, language letter group (or n-gram) frequencies may provide 
         an attack.</p>
     <p>Essentially all ciphers remained vulnerable to cryptanalysis using the frequency analysis technique until the development of 
         the polyalphabetic cipher. While it was known to Al-Kindi to some extent, it was first clearly described in the work of 
         Al-Qalqashandi (1355–1418), based on the earlier work of Ibn al-Durayhim (1312–1359), describing a polyalphabetic cipher 
         in which each plaintext letter is assigned more than one substitute. It was later also described by Leon Battista Alberti 
         around the year 1467, though there is some indication that Alberti's method was to use different ciphers 
         (i.e., substitution alphabets) for various parts of a message (perhaps for each successive plaintext letter at the limit). 
         He also invented what was probably the first automatic cipher device, a wheel that implemented a partial realization of his invention. 
         In the Vigenère cipher, a polyalphabetic cipher, encryption uses a key word, which controls letter substitution depending on 
         which letter of the key word is used. In the mid-19th century Charles Babbage showed that the Vigenère cipher was vulnerable to 
         Kasiski examination, but this was first published about ten years later by Friedrich Kasiski.</p>
     <p>Although frequency analysis can be a powerful and general technique against many ciphers, encryption has still often been effective 
         in practice, as many a would-be cryptanalyst was unaware of the technique. Breaking a message without using frequency analysis 
         essentially required knowledge of the cipher used and perhaps of the key involved, thus making espionage, bribery, burglary, 
         defection, etc., more attractive approaches to the cryptanalytically uninformed. It was finally explicitly recognized 
         in the 19th century that secrecy of a cipher's algorithm is not a sensible nor practical safeguard of message security; 
         in fact, it was further realized that any adequate cryptographic scheme (including ciphers) should remain secure even if the adversary 
         fully understands the cipher algorithm itself. Security of the key used should alone be sufficient for a good cipher 
         to maintain confidentiality under an attack. This fundamental principle was first explicitly stated in 1883 by Auguste Kerckhoffs 
         and is generally called Kerckhoffs's Principle; alternatively and more bluntly, it was restated by Claude Shannon, 
         the inventor of information theory and the fundamentals of theoretical cryptography, as Shannon's Maxim—'the enemy knows the system'. </p>
     <p>Different physical devices and aids have been used to assist with ciphers. One of the earliest may have been the scytale of ancient Greece, 
         a rod supposedly used by the Spartans as an aid for a transposition cipher. In medieval times, other aids were invented such as 
         the cipher grille, which was also used for a kind of steganography. With the invention of polyalphabetic ciphers came more 
         sophisticated aids such as Alberti's own cipher disk, Johannes Trithemius' tabula recta scheme, and Thomas Jefferson's wheel 
         cypher (not publicly known, and reinvented independently by Bazeries around 1900). Many mechanical encryption/decryption devices
         were invented early in the 20th century, and several patented, among them rotor machines—famously including the Enigma machine 
         used by the German government and military from the late 1920s and during World War II. The ciphers implemented by better quality 
         examples of these machine designs brought about a substantial increase in cryptanalytic difficulty after WWI.</p>
    <h2>-Computer era:</h2>
     <p>Prior to the early 20th century, cryptography was mainly concerned with linguistic and lexicographic patterns. 
        Since then the emphasis has shifted, and cryptography now makes extensive use of mathematics, including aspects of information theory, 
        computational complexity, statistics, combinatorics, abstract algebra, number theory, and finite mathematics generally. 
        Cryptography is also a branch of engineering, but an unusual one since it deals with active, intelligent, and malevolent opposition; 
        other kinds of engineering (e.g., civil or chemical engineering) need deal only with neutral natural forces. There is also active 
        research examining the relationship between cryptographic problems and quantum physics. </p>
     <p>Just as the development of digital computers and electronics helped in cryptanalysis, it made possible much more complex ciphers. 
         Furthermore, computers allowed for the encryption of any kind of data representable in any binary format, unlike classical ciphers 
         which only encrypted written language texts; this was new and significant. Computer use has thus supplanted linguistic cryptography, 
         both for cipher design and cryptanalysis. Many computer ciphers can be characterized by their operation on binary bit sequences 
         (sometimes in groups or blocks), unlike classical and mechanical schemes, which generally manipulate traditional characters 
         (i.e., letters and digits) directly. However, computers have also assisted cryptanalysis, which has compensated to some extent 
         for increased cipher complexity. Nonetheless, good modern ciphers have stayed ahead of cryptanalysis; it is typically the case 
         that use of a quality cipher is very efficient (i.e., fast and requiring few resources, such as memory or CPU capability), 
         while breaking it requires an effort many orders of magnitude larger, and vastly larger than that required for any classical cipher, 
         making cryptanalysis so inefficient and impractical as to be effectively impossible. </p>
    <h2>-Advent of modern cryptography:</h2>
      <p>Cryptanalysis of the new mechanical devices proved to be both difficult and laborious. In the United Kingdom, cryptanalytic 
          efforts at Bletchley Park during WWII spurred the development of more efficient means for carrying out repetitious tasks. 
          This culminated in the development of the Colossus, the world's first fully electronic, digital, programmable computer, 
          which assisted in the decryption of ciphers generated by the German Army's Lorenz SZ40/42 machine.</p>
      <p>Extensive open academic research into cryptography is relatively recent; it began only in the mid-1970s. In recent times, 
          IBM personnel designed the algorithm that became the Federal (i.e., US) Data Encryption Standard; Whitfield Diffie 
          and Martin Hellman published their key agreement algorithm; and the RSA algorithm was published 
          in Martin Gardner's Scientific American column. Since then, cryptography has become a widely used tool in communications, 
          computer networks, and computer security generally. </p>
      <p>Some modern cryptographic techniques can only keep their keys secret if certain mathematical problems are intractable, 
          such as the integer factorization or the discrete logarithm problems, so there are deep connections with abstract mathematics. 
          There are very few cryptosystems that are proven to be unconditionally secure. The one-time pad is one, and was proven to be 
          so by Claude Shannon. There are a few important algorithms that have been proven secure under certain assumptions. For example, 
          the infeasibility of factoring extremely large integers is the basis for believing that RSA is secure, and some other systems, 
          but even so, proof of unbreakability is unavailable since the underlying mathematical problem remains open. In practice, 
          these are widely used, and are believed unbreakable in practice by most competent observers. There are systems similar to RSA, 
          such as one by Michael O. Rabin that are provably secure provided factoring n = pq is impossible; it is quite unusable in practice. 
          The discrete logarithm problem is the basis for believing some other cryptosystems are secure, and again, there are related, 
          less practical systems that are provably secure relative to the solvability or insolvability discrete log problem.</p>
      <p>As well as being aware of cryptographic history, cryptographic algorithm and system designers must also sensibly consider probable 
          future developments while working on their designs. For instance, continuous improvements in computer processing power have increased 
          the scope of brute-force attacks, so when specifying key lengths, the required key lengths are similarly advancing. The potential 
          effects of quantum computing are already being considered by some cryptographic system designers developing post-quantum cryptography; 
          the announced imminence of small implementations of these machines may be making the need for preemptive caution rather more than 
          merely speculative.</p>
