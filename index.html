   <p> Cryptography is a method of protecting information and communications through the use of codes, so that only those for whom 
       the information is intended can read and process it. The prefix "crypt-" means "hidden" or "vault" -- and the suffix "-graphy" stands 
       for "writing."</p>

   <p> In computer science, cryptography refers to secure information and communication techniques derived from mathematical concepts 
       and a set of rule-based calculations called algorithms, to transform messages in ways that are hard to decipher. 
       These deterministic algorithms are used for cryptographic key generation, digital signing, verification to protect data privacy, 
       web browsing on the internet, and confidential communications such as credit card transactions and email.</p>
